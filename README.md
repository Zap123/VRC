This fork is a quick and dirty solution to run this software on Linux.

Requirements:
* mono

Usage:
* mono bin/Release/Vinesauce\ ROM\ Corruptor.exe

If you want to compile it you need *monodevelop* and *mono-vbnc*

Known problems:
* Autostart of the emulator doesn't work (run manually)
* Hotkeys are disabled as they doesn't compile in mono

The Vinesauce ROM Corruptor is a program that allows you to change the bytes of any file by tweaking some simple settings.
It's development thus far has been biased toward corrupting NES ROM files for that glitchy fun effect, but since it works on any file it can be used to corrupt any kind of ROM or game data file.
